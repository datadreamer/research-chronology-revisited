A chronological visualization of bookmarking activity.

Research Chronology Revisited is a flash based visualization of a given user's bookmarking activity on del.icio.us. It displays each bookmark as a white dot on a grid of time representing the hours of the day from 00:00 to 23:59 from left to right, and the days of the year from top to bottom. Users select tags on the right side in order to connect bookmark dots together and follow them through history.

This began as a project in Art 101B Art as Information class at San Jose State University in 2005. The initial intention was to design a journal that worked using data we were already generating. I designed the interface to my bookmarks in order to display visual trends in my research activity throughout the day, week, and semester.
